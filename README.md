# Software Engineering 2 Project

This is the repository for the project of the Software Engineering 2 course in Politecnico di Milano.  
In a team of three people, we were asked to design a system to optimize the taxi service of a large city, commissioned by the government. In particular, the goals are to simplify the access of passengers to the service, and to guarantee a fair management of taxi queues.  
The system conists in a web application and a mobile application.
